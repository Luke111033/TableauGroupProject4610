## Data Set: Walkability Index
Link: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/walkability-index8

## 2 questions:
## Project 2 – Group Question 1
How does vehicle ownership vary by population density?

This question explores the relationship between access to private transportation and the density of an area. Areas with higher population density may offer better transit infrastructure, reducing the need for personal vehicles. On the other hand, rural areas often lack public transit, making vehicle ownership essential.

Why it matters: This ties directly into social and economic accessibility. Households without vehicles face limited job access and daily mobility challenges.

Data used:

D1A: Gross population density

Pct_AO0: Percent of households with zero vehicles

Planned analysis: Categorize block groups into Urban, Suburban, and Rural using D1A, then compare Pct_AO0 across those bins.

Expected visualization: Bar chart or boxplot showing the percent of households with no vehicles by density category.

## Project 2 – Group Question 2
Do areas with more diverse land use tend to have lower vehicle miles traveled per capita?

This question looks at how the mix of land uses (e.g. jobs, services, housing) within an area affects travel behavior. Denser and more mixed-use areas are theorized to support shorter trips and more walking or transit usage.

Why it matters: This analysis can support sustainable planning by identifying how mixed-use development might reduce car dependence and emissions.

Data used:

D2B_E5MIX: Land use diversity index (employment-based)

D3BPO4: Vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per capita

Planned analysis: Scatter plot of D2B_E5MIX vs. D3BPO4 to identify trends or correlations.

Expected visualization: Scatter plot with a trendline in Tableau.
